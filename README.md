This repository it is to save my practice of the book Test-Driven Development By Example by Kent Beck

Code is written in Java and uses JUnit 5 for testing.

## Chapter 3 - Money Example
This chapter introduces the test-driven development process with a simple example of creating a `Dollar` class that can handle multiplication.
The tests are written first, and then the implementation is developed to pass those tests.

It's notable that the code written, in the first time, is only to pass the tests, and no additional functionality is added beyond what is required by the tests.
After the tests are passing, the code is refactored to improve its structure and readability.
